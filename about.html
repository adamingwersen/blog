<b> Name: </b> Adam Ingwersen
<b> Born: </b> 1992
<b> Nationality: </b> Danish

I'm an aspiring data scientist with an academic background in economics from UCPH (University of Copenhagen). The main focus of my BSc was econometrics - however, my focus is slowly transitioning towards the exciting field of CompSci and ML. 

<b> Work experience </b>

I am currently employed, part-time, as an assistant data scientist in a danish TelCo/Broadband-provider, focusing on (near) real-time predictive big data analytics, working on my own projects such as sentiment analysis, online data collection, reccomendation engine construction - working interchangeably with tools such as HIVE/Hadoop (implemented by TeraData), R, Python, SQL and SAS. I rely primarily on R & Python whenever possible for data manipulation, visualization and varying analysis pkgs/libs. Knowing SAS and SQL is fairly handy for handling database interactions.

For the past 1,5 years, I've been employed as a student assistant in Denmarks largest bank as a data controller - primarily using SAS, SQL & VBA.
