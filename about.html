I'm an aspiring data scientist with an academic background in economics from UCPH (University of Copenhagen). The main focus of my BSc was econometrics - however, my interests are transitioning towards the exciting field of CompSci and ML.

<h3> Work experience </h3>

<p>I am currently employed, part-time, as an assistant data scientist in a danish TelCo/Broadband-provider, focusing on (near) real-time predictive big data analytics, working on my own projects such as sentiment analysis, online data collection, reccomendation engine construction - working interchangeably with tools such as HIVE/Hadoop (implemented by TeraData), R, Python, SQL and SAS. 
	I rely primarily on R & Python whenever possible for data manipulation, visualization and varying analysis pkgs/libs. Knowing SAS and SQL is fairly handy for handling database interactions.</p>

<p>For the past 1,5 years, I've been employed as a student assistant in Denmarks largest bank as a data controller - primarily using SAS, SQL & VBA.</p>
