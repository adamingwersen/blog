<h1><center> Welcome to Vesterbro </center></h1>
<hr>
We welcome you to our centrally located apartment. We really want you to have a good time whilst in Copenhagen, so we decided to write a guide on where to go in Copenhagen. We hope, you'll enjoy your stay and find this guide somewhat helpful. 

Copenhagen is split into 6 districts: København V(Vesterbro), København S (Amager), København K (Centrum), København Ø (Østerbro), København N (Nørrebro) and Frederiksberg.

This guide will only be concerned with Vesterbro and everything within the close vicinity of the aparment. I strongly urge anyone visiting to see Christianshavn (Christiania), Nyhavn and Nørrebro. 

The recommendations listed below are my own picks. 

<h2><center> Vesterbro </center></h2>
<hr>
Vesterbro is the hip but rough part of Copenhagen. It bolsters a rich nightlife and an array of restaurants/eateries alongside trendy eco-cafés. Vesterbro is as of recently the most expensive part of Copenhagen and captures the essence of Copenhagen in being extremely diverse and food/drink-centered. 

Everything on this list is within walking distance from the Apartment.

<h2><center>What to See</center></h2>
<hr>

<h3><center>Tivoli</center></h3>
It's a given if you're visiting in the summer and haven't already been. 

<center><img src="http://a.bimg.dk/node-images/771/3/800x600-u/3771306-tivoli_om_natten_torben_christensenjpg.jpg"></center>

<hr>

<h3><center>Christiania</center></h3>

<center><img src="http://denstoredanske.dk/@api/deki/files/98018/=Christiania_indgang.jpg"></center>

<font color = "red"> DISCLOSURE: The sale and distribution of marijuana at Christiania has, as of the 2nd of September, been cleared by the inhabitants in cooporation with the Danish police. Christiania is still visitable - and most certainly worth a visit </font>

Christiania has roots in the 60's hippie-movement and was constructed as a free-city inside Copenhagen. Today it serves as one of Copenhagens main tourist attractions. However, many people still live here. In Christiania there are live concerts, arts-shops and of course booths where marijuana can be purchased very easily.


Just to be clear: Distribution of marijuana and hashish is illegal in Denmark - but it's seldomly enforced. It's commonplace to smoke a joint in public areas; just don't do it in front of police officers. 

Even if you're not interested in consuming marijuana, it's worth a visit due to it's cultural history, diverse inhabitants, quaint cafés and restaurants. 

I would adivce taking a walk around the lakes and look at all the hand-built residences - some of which are very interesting.

<h3><center>Frederiksberg Zoo</center></h3>
Zoo on top of a hill. Yes, this is the place where they fed the Giraffe to the lions in front of kids.

<h3><center>Den blå planet (Blue Planet)</center></h3>

<hr>

<h3><center>Lousiana Museum of Modern Art</center></h3>
If you get excited about art and are up for a 1hr train-ride. This museum has some awesome exhibitions, a kids-specific area (they can draw, paint and sculpt themselves - altough it probably won't be showcased) and is right by the water.

<h2><center>Shawarma</center></h2>
<hr>

Shawarma is different throughout european cities. Copenhagen Shawarma is distinctive in it's usage of ingredients like feta, pickled red cabbage and it's fixation on the meat itself. 

<center><img src="https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/11371163_1056012021122717_1810909802_n.jpg"></center>

In my opinion, Nørrebro is the place to go for top-of-the-line shawarma. In particular I recommend Dürum Bar and Kösem, both on Nørrebrogade. 

If you're more into shish, I recommend Kösk Kebab on Frederiksundsvej - a bit further North from Nørrebrogade.

<h2><center>Danish Hotdog</center></h2>

The classic danish hotdog is usually prepared with a roasted sausage, thick ketchup, mustard, remoulade (mayonnaise + pickles), fried onions and sliced gherkins.

<center><img src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/a2/ca/cf/doep.jpg
"></center>

There are a lot of organic variations on this, but the best classic one is found on the Tivoli-side of Copenhagen Central Station. 

<h2><center>Smørrebrød</center></h2>

This open-faced sandwich on rye-bread with various toppings is the staple of traditional danish food. It's been getting a lot of attention as of late - and as such it has been altered and modernised; for the better. Smørrebrød is not a eat-as-you-go sort of food - you are required to sit down in order to consume it. It is also traditionally accompanied by snaps. 

The best modern option is [Aamanns](http://www.aamanns.dk/)
