<center><h3> What is Git? </h3></center>
<hr>
Git is a tool that allows anyone to control and manage each version of a file/folder on their computer. It also allows for collaboration with others working on the same project - and easy sharing of any project. 

<center><h3> Git is not Github </h3></center>
<hr>
While GitHub is great to use alongside Git, Git has a very different history. Git was originally concieved by (amonsgt others) Linus Torvalds - more famously known for creating the Linux kernel. Back then, Git was constructed in order to facilitate the open soruce development of Linux OS.

GitHub emerged later as a derivative of Git. 
Today, Git paired with GitHub allows you to display your work online in repositories that serves as an online backup that you can access from any computer. 

GitHub also allows for cooperation on everything from a school-project to a complete web-development framework - like Ruby on Rails. 

<center><h3> Installation </h3></center>
<hr>
Before we get into the essential Git commands, the software needs to be installed. I use Git with GitKraken. 

<b> Arch Linux Install </b>
```.sh
sudo pacman -S git
yaourt gitkraken
```
<i> Guide on how to set up yaourt (AUR-package manager) coming </i>


<b> Install on Ubuntu/OSX etc </b>
Download [latest Git source package](https://git-scm.com/).
Download [latest GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download).

I primarily use GitKraken to track previous changes and browse local repositories.


<center><h3> Getting started with Git </h3></center>
<hr>

Having succesfully installed Git, you're ready to go ahead and set up using the terminal. Configure your credentials - these should not differ from you GitHub profile information, if you already have one. 

```.sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

# You can set Git to recognize your preferred editor
# Git takes your systems default editor

git config --global core.editor vim
```

If you want to, you can check that you entered the right information by listing the configurations:
```.sh
git config --list
```

By now, you're ready to go ahead and initialize a local repository/repo. You do this by setting you current directory to a folder, you would like to keep track of:

```.sh
cd ~/yourdir/yourfolder
git init
```

To check that everything is working as intended, go ahead and add a line to any of the documents in `yourfolder`. From there, you can stage (add) and commit your files.

```.sh
git add .
git commit -m 'youfirstcommit-ment/'
```

Now, you can open GitKraken and press `Ctrl+o`. This will open a Repo - find the repository, you just created and there you go - now you can track changes. 

It is important to note, that Git will only track your changes as long as you stage and commit your files.
