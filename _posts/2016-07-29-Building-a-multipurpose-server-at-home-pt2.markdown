<h1><center> Part 2: Choosing Linux Distro and DB </center></h1>

This part of the series is concerned with the baseline software needed to run the server from home. 

<h2><center> The Linux Distribution </center></h2>

<h4><center> Ubuntu </center></h4>

<h4><center> RedHat </center></h4>

<h4><center> Arch-Linux </center></h4>


<h2><center> SQL or NoSQL? </center></h2>



<h3><center> A MapReduce-compatible NoSQL DB</center></h3>

One of the advantages of having your own server, is that I do not have to abide by enterprise-grade Oracle or SAS server structures. I see this as a great way for learning about MapReduce - and at some point, a Hadoop environment.

I will go through some of the possible open-source or community-driven solutions, that I found interesting - and I will compare them one-by-one and from there make a decision based on my needs.
